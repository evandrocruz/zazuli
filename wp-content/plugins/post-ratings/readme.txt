Simple, developer-friendly, straightforward post rating plugin. Relies on post meta to store avg. rating / vote count.

== Description ==

What does this plugin do:

* Allow your site users to rate posts (of any kind)
* Display the average post rating, vote count or weighted (bayesian) rating within your posts
* Display a widget with the top rated posts in your sidebar
* Allow you to create your own rating formula

Why another rating plugin? Because the existing ones are either outdated, bloated with useless functionality, or just too buggy :)

== Installation ==

Activate the plugin, and set it up as you wish from the Options dashboard menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin log votes? =

Basic check trough cookies, IP match against a limited transient-cached IP list, and user meta records (if registration-only ratings are enabled). If any of these checks fail the user is not allowed to rate.

= How do I change the stars, CSS and the HTML generated by this plugin? =

Simply create your own styles and drop them inside a file called post-ratings.css in your theme or child theme folder.
Use the original styles as reference if you're doing minor changes.

If you want to change the HTML mark-up for the ratings create a "post-ratings-control.php" template within your theme folder.
Check out the original template from this package for help on how to edit it.

= How do I manually display the rating links where I want? =

Either fill the custom filter field with your own action tag in the plugin settings, or use  the `[rate]` shortcode. If you want to do this within template files, you can manually echo `PostRatings()->getControl();`

= How do I manually get the most rated posts using PHP? =

  `$posts = PostRatings()->getTopRated($arguments);`

Possible arguments, and their defaults:

    'post_type`    => 'post',
    'number'       => 10,                   // max. number of posts to retrieve
    'offset'       => 0,                    // offset from where to start
    'sortby'       => 'bayesian_rating',    // bayesian_rating, rating or votes
    'order'        => 'DESC',               // ASC or DESC
    'date_limit'   => 0,                    // date limit in days

Return value is an array of post objects containing the usual post properties + 3 extra properties:

    $post->votes                            // number of votes
    $post->rating                           // average rating
    $post->bayesian_rating                  // weighted rating

Example usage:

    global $post;
    $results = PostRatings()->getTopRated();

    foreach($results as $post){
      setup_postdata($post); ?>

      // here is the usual loop
      <?php the_title(); ?> - <?php printf(_n('%d vote', '%d votes', $post->votes), $post->votes); ?>

      <?php
    }

    // restore original post
    wp_reset_postdata();
