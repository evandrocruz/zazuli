Lightbox Plus permits users to view larger versions of images, simple slide shows, videos and content all in an overlay.

== Description ==

Lightbox Plus implements ColorBox as a lightbox image overlay tool for WordPress.  <a href="http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox">ColorBox</a> was created by Jack Moore and is licensed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License</a>.  Lightbox Plus for WordPress implements ColorBox as a lightbox image overlay tool for WordPress. ColorBox was created by Jack Moore and is licensed under the MIT License. Lightbox Plus permits users to view larger versions of images without having to leave the current page. Lightbox is able to add a lightbox to WordPress gallery images, display simple slide shows, video, forms and external content in overlays. The use of the dark or light background, which dims the page over which the image has been overlaid, also serves to highlight the image or video being viewed. Lightbox Plus captures the image title for display in the overlay.

Lightbox Plus uses WordPress' built in jQuery library. Lightbox Plus also uses the <a href="http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/" title="PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser">PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser</a> helper class to navigate page content for inserting the Lightbox attibutes into elements.

= Requirements =

Server

* WordPress 2.8+
* PHP 5+ (Required)
* PHP mbstring extension (preferred but no longer required)

Support for PHP 4 has been completely removed - DO NOT UPDATE if you want Lightbox Plus to work with PHP 4.

Client

* IE 7+, Firefox 2+, Chrome, Safari 3+, Opera 8+

= Usage =

Note that getting the caption to appear in the overlay image by using the caption options built into WordPress Lightbox Plus uses the image title which is generated by "Edit Image Title" field and not the "Edit Caption Field."  You can also manually add lightbox tags to your images using the following instructions.

1. Add a rel="lightbox[uniqueID|filename]" attribute to any link tag to activate the lightbox, include a name between square brackets in the rel attibute. For example:

        <a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[uniqueID|filename]" title="my caption">image #1</a>

Optional: Use the title attribute if you want to show a caption.

2. If you have a set of related images that you would like to group, follow step one but additionally include a group name between square brackets in the rel attribute. For example:

        <a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #1</a>
        <a href="images/image-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #2</a>
        <a href="images/image-3.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #3</a>

== Installation ==

= Automatic =

1. In the admin panel plugins page click Add New
2. Search for Lightbox Plus
3. Find Lightbox Plus in the list an click Install Now
4. Click OK when prompted
5. Enjoy!

= Manual =

1. Extract lightbox-plus.zip to your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. In the admin panel under plugins activate Lightbox Plus.
3. In the admin panel under Appearance click on Lightbox Plus to configure to your taste.
4. It should now be completely set up and functional
5. Enjoy!

= Caveats =

Flash (i.e. YouTube videos, etc.) will sit atop the Lightbox Plus display no matter what the z-index is.  This is an issue with Flash.

See <a href="http://go.adobe.com/kb/ts_tn_15523_en-us">Flash content displays on top of all DHTML layers</a> at Adobe for details.

To work around this issue you will need to add something like the following to your <code>&lt;param /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;embed&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;</code> tags:
<code>
        &lt;object&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="opaque" /&gt;&lt;embed wmode="opaque" [all other embed settings, file src etc.]&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
</code>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't get Lightbox Plus to work, why not? =

The problem may be with your WordPress theme, mangling image display properties. Try using another theme, that doesn't interfere with posted images.  You may be lacking <code>wp_footer()</code> function in your <code>footer.php</code> of your WordPress theme.  Look at the default theme to see how it is implemented.

Alternately you may have other plugins that conflict with Lightbox Plus. Try disabling your other plugins and see if that helps. If it does, re-enable each plugin, one at a time to see which one is causing the conflict.  Please let me know which plugin is causing the problem.

Finally, it seems that recent version of WordPress (or perhaps the plugin is causing this in some way I am not aware of) do not automatically add the link to the full size image.  You must also make sure that when you are adding an image from the WordPress media dialog control you must make sure there is a link to the image in the Link URL field.  The easiest way to get the correct link is to click on the link to image button beneath the field.  <a href="http://www.23systems.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/file.png">Visual depiction</a> of what is required when adding images in order for lightbox to function correctly.

= Lightbox Plus doesn't work properly in browser X, Y, or Z (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Explorer 6, 7, etc.)? =

Yes it probably does, the problems may be the same as above or there may be a conflict with another plugin or a style conflict.  It has been tested in Chrome, IE 7+, Firefox 2+, Chrome, Safari 3+, Opera 8+ since development began.

= Does Lightbox Plus work with PHP 4? If not, why not? =

No it doesn't.  PHP 4 reached end of life on August 8th 2008 (over 3 years ago.)  WordPress no longer supports PHP 4 and all plugin developers are encourage to follow.  The best solution at this time is to ask your host provider to upgrade to PHP 5.

You will know that Lightbox Plus is not working because of PHP if you receive the following error:

<b>Plugin couldn't be activated because of fatal error</b>

<code>Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_OBJECT_OPERATOR in /path/to/plugin/classes/filters.class.php on line 81</code>

= Can I use this plugin and Lightview Plus, Lightbox 2 (either one), WP lightbox JS Plugin at the same time? =

No other lightbox plugins can be used, they will most likely interfere with each other as they all modify the image URLs.  Other image overlay plugins may possibly be compatible.

= Can I add my own styles and images for the overlay? =

Yes, you can easily create additional styles by adding a new folder to the CSS directory under <code>wp-content/plugins/lightbox-plus/css/</code> by duplicating and modifying any of the existing theme folders or using them as examples to create your own.

= How does Lightbox Plus differ from other Lightbox plugins for WordPress? =

Performance wise the ColorBox jQuery plugin is smaller and generally faster and has more options than most lightbox JavaScript plugins.  The regular expressions that handle the text are more robust handling a wider variety of characters and in addition it will also grab the image title from the image to use for the overlay image caption.

= Does Lightbox Plus work with WordPress' built in gallery =

Yes it does.  There are few simple requirements however.  You must set <strong>Link thumbnails to: Image File</strong> or use <code>[gallery link="file"</code> for the gallery options.  You must check <em>Use For WP Gallery</em> box under <strong>Other Lightbox Plus Settings</strong>

= When resetting/re-initializing LBP the setting do not appear correctly when the page reloads, what gives? =

This problem is only apparent in Chrome and Opera.  It seems to works fine in Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari.  There are some browser related issues and I am investigating the problem at this time.  For Chrome the settings are being saved but not displayed immediately, click on the Lightbox Plus link under appearance and you will see the current settings.  Opera for whatever reason is completely failing to save re-initialization settings, you must manually set and save them or use another browser.  And, no, it doesn't make sense since it's server side activity.

= Additional FAQs from Colorbox =

= ColorBox is positioned incorrectly or behaving strangely in Internet Explorer =

This is likely a doctype issue. ColorBox requires a valid doctype and rendering in quirks mode is not supported. Make sure you are using the full doctype declaration to insure rendering in standards mode.

This abbreviated doctype renders the document in quirks mode for Internet Explorer: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">

The doctype with URI renders in standards mode for all browsers: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

For more information, see A List Apart's <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/doctype/">primer on doctypes</a>.

= ColorBox's borders do not display in Internet Explorer =

Some of the example styles provided make use of transparent .PNG files. Alpha transparencies aren't supported by default in IE6, and can cause an undesirable 'black halo' effect in IE7 and IE8 when changing their opacity. ColorBox resolves this by using one of IE's CSS filters. You can see these at the bottom of colorbox.css. The filter src paths are relative to the HTML document (just like an IMG element), while CSS background image paths are relative to the CSS document. In the examples I provide the relative path is the same, but users often change the directory structure once they move the files over to their own host. The filter src path needs to reflect this change with the appropriate relative path or an absolute path. Here is an example that assumes the 'images' folder is in the root directory:

Original CSS with incorrect relative path: .AlphaImageLoader(src=images/internet_explorer/borderTopLeft.png

Corrected relative path: .AlphaImageLoader(src=/images/internet_explorer/borderTopLeft.png

Corrected absolute path: .AlphaImageLoader(src=http://your_domain.com/images/internet_explorer/borderTopLeft.png

= Other Problems =

If you have read and tried the above and you are still having problems, then, please post your issues, in detail (links, error messages) to my site.

<a href="http://www.23systems.net/plugins/lightbox-plus/">http://www.23systems.net/plugins/lightbox-plus/</a>

= Known Problems =

* Does not work correctly with W3 Total Cache if you are using automatic minify settings.  You can manually set up minify to work correctly bypassing Lightbox Plus (jquery-colorbox.min.js)
* No support for iPad (if someone wants to donate an iPad to me I will guarantee support)
 * It should work though I just don't support it.
* In some instances performance may be slow in older versions IE - this may be due to plugin conflicts or slow JavaScript performance in IE.
* Lightboxed video does not seem to work in IE on locally installed sites, for example viewing in IE 7.0 while running XAMPP, this seems to be a Windows only issue.

= Plugin Conflicts =

* Jetpack Carousel - When carousel is activate it take precedence over Lightbox Plus for image use.
* Flickr Mini Gallery - Verified.  Download hot fix for <a href="http://23systems.net/downloads/file/flickr-mini-gallery-jquery-hotfix.zip">Flickr Mini Gallery</a> (includes instructions)
* Tabbed Widgets - Verified
* DMSGuestbook - Un-verified
* Gengo - Un-verified

Note: These conflicts may now be mitigated as of version 1.6.3.

 * Add flag: LOCK_EX while calling "file_put_contents()". 
 * Fix the typo of "token_blank_t".
 * Supports xpath generated from Firebug.

 * Added property "data" to specify GET or POST data when using Ajax.  ColorBox's ajax functionality is handled by jQuery's .load() method, so the data property works the same way as it does with .load().
 * Added property "fixed" which can provide fixed positioning for ColorBox, rather than absolute positioning.  This will allow ColorBox to remain in a fixed position within the visitors viewport, despite scrolling.  IE6 support for this was not added, it will continue to use the default absolute positioning.
 * Fixed ClearType problem with IE7.
 * Minor fixes.
* Updated ColorBox to verion 1.3.16

 * In IE6, closing an iframe when using HTTPS no longer generates a security warning.
 * Changed the index.html example files to use YouTube's new embedded link format.
 * By default, ColorBox returns focus to the element it was launched from once it closes.  This can now be disabled by setting the 'returnFocus' property to false.  Focus was causing problems for some users who had their anchor elements inside animated containers.
 * Minor bug fix involved in using a combination of slideshow and non-slideshow content.
 * Minor bug fix involved in preloading images when using a function as a value for the href property.
 * The slideshow now respects the loop property.
 * Fixed compatibility with jQuery 1.4.3
 * The 'open' property now accepts a function as a value, like all of the other properties.
 * Preloading now loads the correct href for images when using a dynamic (function) value for the href property.
 * Fixed bug in Safari 3 for Win where ColorBox centered on the document, rather than the visitor's viewport.
 * May have fixed an issue in Opera 10.6+ where ColorBox would rarely/randomly freeze up while switching between photos in a group.
 * Some functionality better encapsulated & minor performance improvements.

= 2.2 =
* Fixed "Object id #", "Object", "Object #" errors with PHP 5.1.x.
 * Problem was due to circular memory leak in PHP 5.1 and 5.2 and HTML DOM object not being cleaned up.
 * Altered way the content is returned to allow for closure and cleaning of object sooner eliminating memory leak.
* Due to overwhelming demand I added PHP 4 functionality back in but it is not officially supported.
 * If you were seeing an error that looked something like `Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or '}' in /path/to/plugins/lightbox-plus/classes/shd.class.php on line 86` you have PHP 4.
 * Option is automatically set to use legacy method if you have PHP 4
 * You will have to manually select the option to use the <em>PHP 4 Auto Lightbox Method</em> if you are using PHP 5.X and wish to use legacy method.
* Fix for images with upper case file extension not being auto-lightboxed.
* Probable fix for `XML Parsing Error: no element found` likely caused by memory leak
 * Unable to reproduce error but research indicates memory leak is a likely cause.

= 2.1 =
* Now requires PHP 5+, no PHP 4 support.
 * PHP4 reached its end of life on 8/8/2008 nearly 2 years ago.
* Fixed problems with initialization and re-initialization of the plugin not working under various circumstances.
 * Add code for activation/deactivation of the plugin
* Added true HTML parser instead of regular expressions
 * Using <a href="http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/">PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser</a> for parsing HTML

 * Admin and plugin styles are now enqueued correctly.
* Fixed slideshow always auto-starting if slideshow enabled.
* Changed several variables and related fields
 * <em>Do Not Auto-Lightbox Images</em> using `auto_lightbox` to `no_auto_lightbox` to accurately reflect its use.
 * <em>Do Not Display Image Title</em> using `display_titles` to `no_display_titles` to accurately reflect its use.
 * <em>Use Class Method using</em> `class_method` to `use_class_method` to accurately reflect it's use.
 * If you use any of these settings you will need to re-check them and save your settings.
* Reduced size of inline JavaScript and converted all to jQuery.
 * Reduced size of some scripts using old toggle method for help.

= 2.0.2 =
* Add quick fix/hack for a big interface issue on the admin panel. See roadmap for long term solution.
 * jQuery UI themes were overloading other plugins that were using the jQuery UI
 * Lightbox Plus specific themes and scripts should only load on Lightbox Plus panel
 * The exception is colorbox.min.js will load in any admin panel due to the way it is initialized. Expect version 2.0.5 to address this.

= 2.0.1 =
* Fixed several interface issues in the admin panel.
 * User feedback was not reporting updates because admin scripts were not loading properly - this has been fixed.

* Added backend test/demo areas
 * Allows user to test lightbox settings in the admin panel
 * Provides demos and examples for secondary lightbox using video, external webpages and interactive flash
 * Provides demos and examples for inline lightbox using inline content
* Fixed issue with saving setting and changes not being reflected.
* Updated ColorBox to version 1.3.8

 * Fixed a bug in IE7 that existed with some iframed websites that use JS to reposition the viewport caused ColorBox to move out of position.
 * Abstracted the identifiers (HTML ids & classes, and JS plugin name, method, and events) so that the plugin can be easily rebranded.
 * Small changes to improve either code readability or compression.

= 1.7 =
* Updated ColorBox to verion 1.3.7
 * $.colorbox can now be used for direct calls and accessing public methods.  Example: $.colorbox.close();
 * Resize now accepts 'width', 'innerWidth', 'height' and 'innerHeight'. Example: $.colorbox.resize({width:"100%"})
 * Added option (loop:false) to disable looping in a group.
 * Added options (escKey:false, arrowKey:false) to disable esc-key and arrow-key bindings.
 * Added method for removing ColorBox from a document: $.colorbox.remove();
 * Fixed a bug where iframed URLs would be truncated if they contained an unencoded apostrophe.
 * Now uses the exact href specified on an anchor, rather than the version returned by 'this.href'. This was causing "#example" to be normalized to "http://domain/#example" which interfered with how some users were setting up links to inline content.

= 1.6.9.7 =
* Fixed auto-lightbox breaking links that contained manually created `rel="lightbox[]"` attributes.

= 1.6.9.6 =

= 1.6.9 =
* Fixed problem with styles in IE 6/7/8 not working under various circumstances (hopefully)
* Added the option to disable Lightbox Plus from adding its own styles allowing the user to place Lightbox/Colorbox styles in their theme stylesheet and reduce number of files loading.

 * Small change to make Colorbox compatible with jQuery 1.4
 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.4 with IE7's display of example 2 and example 3, and auto-width in Opera.
 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.4 where colorbox could not be launched by triggering an element's click event through JavaScript.
 * Minor refinements.
 * Event delegation is now used for elements that ColorBox is assigned to, rather than individual click events.
 * Additional callbacks have been added to represent other stages of ColorBox's lifecycle. Available callbacks, in order of their execution: `onOpen`, `onLoad`, `onComplete`, `onCleanup`, `onClosed` These take place at the same time as the event hooks, but will be better suited than the hooks for targeting specific instances of ColorBox.
 * Ajax content is now immediately added to the DOM to be more compatible if that content contains script tags.
 * Focus is now returned to the calling element on closing.
 * Fixed a bug where `maxHeight` and `maxWidth` did not work for non-photo content.
 * Direct calls no longer need `'open:true'`, it is assumed.  Example: `$.fn.colorbox({html:"<p>Hi</p>"});`
 * Changed `$.fn.colorbox.element()` to return a jQuery object rather the DOM element.
 * jQuery.colorbox-min.js is compressed with Google's Closure Compiler rather than YUI Compressor.
 * Added `'innerWidth'` and `'innerHeight'` options to allow people to easily set the size dimensions for ColorBox, without having to anticipate the size of the borders and buttons.
 * Renamed `'scrollbars'` option to `'scrolling'` to be in keeping with the existing HTML attribute.  The option now also applies to iframes.
 * Bug fix: In Safari, positioning occassionally incorrect when using '100%' dimensions.
 * Bug fix: In IE6, the background overlay is briefly not full size when first viewing.
 * Bug fix: In Firefox, opening ColorBox causes a split second shift with a small minority of webpage layouts.
 * Simplified code in a few areas.
* Special thanks for navjotjsingh for the include, excude fix for WordPress built in gallery

= 1.6.3 =
* Eliminated conflict with Featured Content plug-in
 * Removed `jQuery.noConflict()` due to poor implementation on my part.
 * Kept `$lbp` jQuery variable.
* jQuery conflicts should all be resolved - hopefully.
* Minor modification to `wp_enqueue_script` function cal to include colorbox version.

 * Working on solving auto lightboxing issues with WordPress Mu

= 1.6.2 =
* Added `jQuery.noConflict()` to the initiator to hopefully eliminate issues with other jQuery libraries loading and causing conflicts.
 * Changed jQuery `$` variable to `$lbp` to give a unique constructor.
* Added replacement shortcode gallery method to allow Lightbox Plus to work with shortcode galleries called via the `echo do_shortcode('[gallery link="file" size="thumbnail"]');` method in templates.

* Updated ColorBox to version 1.3.1 with the following changes
  * Removed the IE-only stylesheets and conditional comments.  All CSS is handled by a single CSS file for all examples.
  * Removed user-agent sniffing from the js and replaced it with feature detection.  This will allow correct rendering for visitors masking their agent type.
  * Added `$.fn.colorbox.resize()` method to allow ColorBox to resize it's height if it's contents change.
  * Added `scrollbars` option to allow users to turn off scrollbars when using the `resize()` method.
  * Renamed the `resize` option to be less ambiguous.  It's now `scalePhotos`.
