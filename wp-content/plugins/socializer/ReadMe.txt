Socializer! is a fast plugin to share posts on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and more top social networks, Google Plus, by eMail, even translate them...

== Description ==

With the free Socializer! plugin you can have your posts shared on more than 30 top social networks, including Facebook and Twitter, have them promoted in Google Plus, recommended by eMail, even let your visitors translate them to a different language... 

Socializer! keeps your pages light and fast, since it loads just a single image, not lengthy scripts, etc.

Socializer! is absolutely self-dependent; it won't change anything in your database.

When a user clicks on the Socializer! button, a clean and pleasant control panel in a new window offers sharing and translation options. Socializer! supports Google Bookmarks and Google Plus submission, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, eMail recommendation, Google Translate, HTML Code (href) for Link and Share Link, Short URL version with TinyURL, BlinkList, BlogMarks, Del.Icio.Us, Digg, Evernote, FormSpring, FriendFeed, Linkedin, LiveJournal, Chime, MySpace, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Technorati, Connotea, DotNetKicks, DZone,  Fark, Faves, LinkArena, LinkaGoGo, MisterWong, N4G, NewsVine, Netvouz, NuJIJ, Scoopeo, Tipd, Tumblr, Xerpi.

Socializer! will let you choose what to share - posts or pages, or both posts and pages, place the share button at the top of your content or at the bottom, or in both locations. The Socializer! sharing button can appear in individual posts and pages, and also on Archives (Categories, Tags, Dates, Home/Index pages).

Alternatively or along with this button, you can use the Socializer! Widget, letting you share from your sidebar(s) each and every page of your blog. The default buttons can be replaced with any whatever you like. Use the Settings page to change them.

Socializer! will also let you use css styles to customize the position, alignment etc, of both the content and the widget buttons - even completely replace the Socializer! buttons with custom ones of your own! It will also let you create manually occasional / sporadic share-links independently of the regular buttons.

The plugin supports also WordPress multisite MS / MU installations. 

* Note that, if you have also a non-WordPress php site, or asp, simple html etc, there is a [Javascript Edition of Socializer!](http://www.thefreewindows.com/5641/socializer-javascript/), letting you offer to your visitors the chance to share and / or translate your pages easily. [Socializer! for Firefox](http://www.thefreewindows.com/5915/socializer-firefox/), for [Chrome](http://www.thefreewindows.com/11319/socializer-chrome/), for [Internet Explorer](http://www.thefreewindows.com/11432/socializer-internet-explorer/), or for [any major browser](http://www.thefreewindows.com/5897/socializer-bookmarklet/) will let you share or translate any page you visit yourself.

== Installation ==

To install Socializer! follow the usual way of installing WordPress plugins: unzip the archive and upload the "socializer" folder inside the plugins folder of your blog, then activate Socializer! and configure it. Both content and widget options are configured from the Socializer! admin page at the Settings section of your blog.

For WordPress multisite MS / MU installations you can activate the Socializer! globally, for all the sites of your network, or just install it on the main (network admin) site, leave it deactivated there, and activate it on (any number of) individual sites in your network.

You can also create occasional share-links manually, if you need to, when you write a page or post and make references to some other post or page. Read instructions for this at [Socializer! Downloads](http://www.thefreewindows.com/11487/incorporating-socializer-web-scripts-software-creating-manual-sharelinks/)
