The AddThis Social Bookmarking Widget allows any visitor to bookmark and share your site easily with over 330 popular services. 

== Description ==
Get more traffic back to your site by installing the AddThis WordPress plugin. With AddThis, your users can promote your content by sharing to 330 of the most popular social networking and bookmarking sites (like Facebook, Twitter, Digg, StumbleUpon and MySpace). We also support address bar sharing in modern browsers. Our button is small, unobtrusive, quick to load and recognized all over the web. 

Optionally, sign up for a free AddThis.com account to see how your visitors are sharing your content: which services they're using for sharing, which content is shared the most, and more.

We also have plugins available for <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/addthis-follow/'>increasing followers on social networks</a>, <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/addthis-welcome/'>welcoming users based on social behavior</a>, and <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/addthis-social-sign-in'>adding social authentication</a> to your WordPress blog.
